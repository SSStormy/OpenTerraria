# TerrariaBridge
A small library used to simulate a terraria client. Mainly intended for reading chat data.

# State
Currently it's very basic. 
It can send and receive and create Terraria packets. 
It also has a login routine, meaning you can log into a vanilla Terraria server. (tshock hasn't been tested)

# Future
I have plans to turn this into a sort of relay bridge thing that others can use to extract information given to clients by a Terraria server (such as chat data, for an irc-like bot, world info, even info etc)

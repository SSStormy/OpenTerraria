# OpenTerraria
A small library aimed at recreating a Terraria client.

# Capabilities
In it's current state, this project can do basically anything a normal Terraria client except rendering, sound playback and control handling.

It has been built around the vanilla Terraria v1.3.0.8 (156 internally) server.
Tshock support has not been tested and is not planned.

# Prerequisites
